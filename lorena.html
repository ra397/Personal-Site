        <p>&emsp;Throughout history, cultures all over the world have used plants to heal various ailments. Through generations of experimentation, these groups developed plant-based traditional medicines to treat common illnesses.  In modern times, technological advancements have allowed scientists to modify the compounds from these traditional remedies into more potent, efficient pharmaceuticals.  Though modern drugs enable doctors to treat a much wider variety of conditions, in some cases the body has difficulty processing the synthetic compounds, which results in side effects.  This, coupled with the rising cost of healthcare and medications, has prompted many people to consider natural alternatives and has inspired the growth of scientific research on medicinal plants.</p>
        <p>&emsp;The purpose of these posts is to inform the reader about traditional uses of medicinal plants and the scientific evidence supporting these uses.  While many online sources sell plant mixtures and extracts claiming that they can cure diseases, these claims are rarely supported by science.  Because medicinal plants are a relatively new field in the research world, few large clinical trials have been conducted to determine whether plants could replace any modern medication.  These posts provide summaries of the current research on medicinal plants and gives a realistic view of their abilities.  They also show the connections between the traditional uses and the scientifically proven properties of each medicinal plant. These plants can all be found in the state of Iowa, though some are non-native.  Readers from Iowa are encouraged to explore local fields and hiking trails to find these plants in the wild!</p>

        <h2>Chamomile: A Calmer</h2>
        <h3>Matricaria chamomilla</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/chamomile.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Chamomile tea, which is made from dried chamomile flowers, was first used as a calming drink by the ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Greeks.  Since then, the plant has been used in native traditions around the world to induce calm.  Chamomile has also been used to treat muscle spasms and fever.  In the Middle Ages, Europeans used chamomile essential oil for this, while African folk remedies use the chamomile flower.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Research in modern times shows that chamomile’s calming properties have the potential to treat many conditions.  Studies have found that chamomile reduces the physical and mental effects of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), a series of symptoms that commonly affect women during their periods.  In particular, chamomile tea reduces stress and anxiety, as well as diminishing cramp-related pain.  In addition to PMS, studies suggest that chamomile could aid in treating mental health conditions.  Chamomile extract capsules were found to decrease symptoms of General Anxiety Disorder and improve mood, suggesting that chamomile may have antidepressant properties.</p>

        <h2>Dandelion: A Detoxifier</h2>
        <h3>Taraxacum officinale</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/dandelion.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;The first documented use of dandelion’s medicinal properties was in the 1500s, when German physicians used mixtures of dandelion leaves and roots to treat liver problems.  Various cultures have used dandelion’s detoxifying properties in their traditional medicine.  In traditional Chinese medicine, dandelion is used as a diuretic, or a substance that rids the body of excess salt and water by increasing urine production6. Turkish traditions also use dandelion as a laxative, while early Native American medicine used dandelion root extracts to treat indigestion.  So, dandelion’s abilities to detoxify the body’s liver and intestinal tract have been recognized for hundreds of years.</p>
        <p>&emsp;However, modern biomedical research has only recently begun to investigate the dandelion’s medicinal properties. Recent research on dandelion leaf extract has supported the plant’s role in Chinese medicine as a diuretic, which suggests that dandelion could be used to treat high blood pressure. Diuretics like dandelion remove excess water and salt from the blood, resulting in lower blood pressure.  Researchers also found that one of dandelion’s active compounds – taraxasterol – prevents alcohol damage in the livers of mice. This finding could potentially assist in the development of protective treatments for liver damage due to alcoholism.</p>

        <h2>Echinacea: A Treatment for the Common Cold</h2>
        <h3>Echinacea purpurea/angustifolia</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/echinacea.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Different cultures recognize echinacea as a treatment for conditions that affect the lungs and breathing.  Indian Ayurvedic medicine uses echinacea roots and extracts to treat respiratory viruses and boost the immune system.  Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine uses echinacea to prevent and treat upper respiratory tract infections.  Several Native American tribes also used Echinacea to lessen symptoms of the common cold and tonsillitis.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Most research on echinacea focuses on its abilities to treat the common cold. Many studies have found that extracts and infusions of echinacea root can decrease the length of the common cold and lessen the chances of infection with a cold.  Echinacea treatments may also prevent respiratory conditions caused by bacterial infections, as researchers discovered that extracts of echinacea stop the growth of bacteria causing strep throat and pneumonia.</p>

        <h2>Jewelweed: A Poison Ivy Antidote</h2>
        <h3>Impatiens capensis</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/jewelweed.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Jewelweed has historically been used to soothe skin conditions.  In Japanese traditional medicine, crushed jewelweed flowers are used to combat itching, while in traditional Chinese Medicine, jewelweed leaves are recommended as a treatment for pain and swelling.  Native American tribes also use jewelweed as a medicine to treat skin rashes from poison ivy and stinging nettles, as well as insect bites.  </p>
        <p>&emsp;Researchers have found that mash made from blended jewelweed reduces rashes from poison ivy just as effectively as dish soap, which is another common treatment.  Jewelweed is effective at treating poison ivy rashes because it contains saponins, or compounds that behave like soaps. These compounds alleviate rashes by breaking down the oil that poison ivy deposits on the skin.  So, in situations where soap is not on hand, jewelweed provides a quick remedy for poison ivy exposure.  In addition, jewelweed usually grows near poison ivy plants, which makes it a convenient treatment.  The plant also has anti-inflammatory properties, which explains its ability to treat poison ivy and suggests that it could treat other inflammatory conditions, such as rashes and infections.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Lavender: A Sleep Aid</h2>
        <h3>Lavandula angustifolia</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/lavender.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Lavender’s ability to promote and enhance sleep has long been recognized by traditional medicine.  In Europe, lavender-scented bath salts, teas, and laundry detergent are traditionally recommended for restless sleepers and those with difficulty falling asleep.  In traditional Chinese medicine, lavender is said to relax the mind and relieve the body’s tension, which can aid stress and sleep problems. </p>
        <p>&emsp;In contemporary times, several studies have investigated lavender as a treatment for insomnia.  Aromatherapy, or exposure to diffused lavender oil in the air, was found to increase blood melatonin levels in adults over the age of 60.  Melatonin regulates a person’s sleep and wake cycle, so this increase in melatonin levels indicates that lavender facilitates falling asleep and reduces sleep disorders.  This is especially significant for older people, as insomnia becomes more prevalent with aging.  Smelling lavender essential oil was also found to increase sleep quality in patients with diabetes.  Improved sleep is especially important for diabetics – it can lead to reduced blood sugar, which lessens diabetes symptoms. </p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>St. John's wort: A Natural Antidepressant</h2>
        <h3>Hypericum perforatum</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/stjohnswort.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Though currently found worldwide, St. John’s wort is native to Europe, which is where it was first used medicinally.  In ancient Greece, St. John’s wort was used for burns and open wounds, as well as insomnia. Beyond physical impairments, St. John’s wort can be used to treat depression, the first documented instance of this being in 17th-century Germany.  Since then, it has become one of the most popular medicinal remedies for depression, with traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine using St. John’s wort to calm the mind and lift the spirits.</p>
        <p>&emsp;St. John’s wort’s function as an antidepressant has been extensively studied.  Though the plant cannot treat severe depression, studies have found that it is effective in treating mild to moderately severe depression.  Notably, researchers found that St. John’s wort extract treats depression just as effectively as conventional antidepressant medications, with fewer side effects of anxiety, headaches and loss of appetite.  Studies have also shown that St. John’s wort can treat Seasonal Affective Disorder, also known as seasonal depression.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>White Willow: A Natural Aspirin</h2>
        <h3>Salix alba</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/willow.jpg" width="450" height= auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Throughout history, willow has been commonly used as a pain reliever.  Ancient Egyptians used extracts of willow leaves to treat nonspecific pains, while ancient Greeks used willow to lessen pains during childbirth.  Sumerians also used willow leaves to treat inflammatory and arthritic conditions.  More recently, Native American tribes use willow to treat fevers, headaches, and arthritis.  </p>
        <p>&emsp;In the 1900s, the active compound of willow, salicin, was modified to create aspirin.  Because salicin is very similar to the active compound in aspirin, willow bark powder or extract could potentially be substituted for aspirin to relieve mild pain.  This notion has not been thoroughly studied, but researchers found that willow bark extract can treat lower back pains, joint pains associated with arthritis, fever, and general body aches.</p>
        <br><br><br>

        <h2>Yarrow: A Wound Healer</h2>
        <h3>Achillea millefolium</h3>
        <div class="pics">
            <img src = "Lorena/yarrow.jpg" width="450" height=auto>
        </div>
        <p>&emsp;Traditional medicines use yarrow to treat a variety of conditions, the most common being for healing wounds.  In Hungarian traditional medicine, ointments made from yarrow leaves are used to treat burns and open wounds.  European and Brazilian remedies use yarrow ointments and poultices to stop bleeding and treat skin rashes.  Traditional Chinese medicine also treats wounds and bruising with yarrow, but additionally uses it for snakebites and varicose veins.</p>
        <p>&emsp;Few large-scale studies have assessed yarrow’s medicinal properties.  However, in smaller studies yarrow has been found to promote quicker cell and tissue growth, which explains its role as a wound healer in traditional cultures.  Yarrow also has anti-inflammatory properties, as it reduced swelling in women who had recently given birth as well as patients with mouth and throat inflammation.</p>
